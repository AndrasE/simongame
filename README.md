  Simon Game with JQuery
</h3>

## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This project was a part of my self-study while taking a **[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp)** course on **[jQuery](https://jquery.com/)**. 

It involves generating random numbers between 1 and 4, assigning corresponding colors from an array, and pushing them into a new sequence. The challenge for the user is to replicate the sequence correctly, or they lose the game. I enhanced the experience by adding sound effects and animations to make it more engaging and visually appealing. I also incorporated media queries for better responsiveness on smaller screens. Overall, a great beginner project!
