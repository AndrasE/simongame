## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This project was part of my self-study. Introduction to jquery part of a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Udemy</a> course. Creating random number between 1-4 and allocate a color of an array to them, which gets pushed in an other array. The user will try to recreate the same array or will loose the game. Some playsound and animation added to make it more visual. I also added some @medias for smaller screens. Good little starter project! ðŸŸ©
  
Take care, code safe! ðŸ’»

## Run ðŸš€
As its only uses HTML, CSS and JS you wont need much:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/AndrasE/drum
$ cd PROJECTNAME
$ open index.html
```
